Microservices

**Monolith:
      1) All components are part of single unit.
       2) Everything is developed, deployes and scaled a single unit.
       3) Application must be written in single tech stack.
       4) Single artifact, so we must redeploy the entire application on each update.
       5) Disadvantages of monolith architecture is single code base, single tech stack, single artifact, redeploy for each change.

Challenges of Monolith Architecture:

      1) Application is too large and complex.
      2) Components are tightly coupled each other.
      3) We can scale entire application, instead of a specific service or feature.
      4) Difficult if services need different dependency versions.
      5) Release process takes longer- On every change, entire application needs to be tsted and entire application needs to be               built and deployed.
      6) Bug in one module can potentially bring down the entire application.

  MICROSERVICES:
      Break the application in essentially multiple smaller independent applications so we have several independent small applications taht make up this one big application.
      -> Loosely coupled
      -> Developed independently
      -> Deployed independently
      -> Scaled independently
